# Civi McREST Face (CMRF) connector for Wordpress

This provides a connector for Wordpress to access remote CiviCRM databases using [CMRF](https://github.com/CiviMRF)

**Warning** I've struggled to understand CMRF and based this on hacking the Drupal CMRF Core.

I've got it working, but it's in no way as complete as the Drupal one. I just didn't want to re-invent the wheel.

PRs and support welcome!
